  - I implemented shared Vector3 variable for sending a vector3 value to any required components
  - I think may be an overlap sphere is better for weapon pickup

  - Input system is slow, really slow compared to Unity's legacy input system (This may be because of using UnityEvents instead of SendMessages or C# events)
  - We need to start work on audio manager with 32 audio sources as audio buffer.
  - Changed how inventory is stored in player (Requires re visist)
  - Update weapons prefabs with InventoryItem script
  - A dedicated animation manager and animation programmer is needed.
